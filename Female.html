    <div class="text"> This character image was taken from a game called Mortal Kombat X. A significant portion of video games portray all women as beautiful, skinny with an hourglass figure. Furthermore, video games portray women as 'weaker' characters. Females typically have less health and do less damage than their male counterpart. However, to compensate for their lack of damage, specificaly in fighting games such as Mortal Kombat, female characters have faster movement speed. Almost all of the street fighting oversexualize their female characters and follow the stereotype. This reflects society as a whole by constantly oversexualizing women and portraying them as the weaker sex. </div>
